# Ballard React

## "The goal of the group project is to synthesize the information your group found in the community visit, the community research, and evaluation of sources as a way to introduce your community and topic to the rest of the FIG."

This website acts as an online presentation for our group, "Team Bigfoot"'s adventure in the neighborhood of Ballard in Seattle.
